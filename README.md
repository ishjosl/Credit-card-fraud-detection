# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Introduction 
#This repository contains a Python project for detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, focusing on the classification of fraudulent transactions.
## Dataset
###The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data. It consists of transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset contains a total of 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent. The features are numerical, and due to confidentiality reasons, they have been transformed using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) transformation.
